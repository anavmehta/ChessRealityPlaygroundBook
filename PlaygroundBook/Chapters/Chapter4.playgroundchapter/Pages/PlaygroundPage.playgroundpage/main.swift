 # Play with Another Device
 - Play with another using the same playgroundbook or the companion ChessReality app on the appstore.
 - Press **Run My Code** or "Play With Opponent" from LiveView and use **landscape** for best experience.
 - Pair with another device on your WiFi network - your id and your peerid will turn green when you pair. You may have to wait for 30sec-1min for the pairing to take place.
 - Move your camera before tapping for board placement for better detection of horizontal feature points.
 - The first one who places the board plays white.
 - If you need a hint use the **yellow bulb** button.
 Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
