A few functions were defined to use for the

 - sound(enabled: Bool) - enables or disables the sound
 - animation(enabled: Bool) - enables or disables the animation
 - tap(str:str) - taps the piece at position [a-h][1-8]
 - move(str:str) moves the piece from position [a-h][1-8] -> [a-h][1-8]
 Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
