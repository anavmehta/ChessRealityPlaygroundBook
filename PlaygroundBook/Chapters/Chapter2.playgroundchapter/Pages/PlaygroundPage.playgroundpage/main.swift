 # Play Progammatically
A few functions were defined to use for the
 - play()
    - Starts or resets the game in the mode it was set to.
 - mode(_ mode: PlayingMode)
    - Sets the game to either .SingleDevice, .Computer or .MultiDevice
 - sound(_ enabled: Bool)
    - Turn on or off the sound
 - animation(_ enabled: Bool)
    - enables or disables the animation
 - tap(_ position: String)
    - taps the piece at position (Algebraic Notation) [a-h][1-8].
 - move(_ move: String)
    - moves the piece from position (Algebraic Notation) [a-h][1-8] to position [a-h][1-8].
 Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
