 # Introduction to ChessReality
 Move your camera and debug feature points will help you place a 20cmx20cm chessboard with a tap on a horizontal surface. A single tap will select a piece displaying the legal moves and a second tap will place the piece.
 
 Play in SingleDevice, Computer or with another player in MultiDevice mode.
 - Remember:
    - Press **Run My Code** and use **landscape** for best experience.
    - Move your camera before tapping for board placement for better detection of horizontal feature points.
 Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
